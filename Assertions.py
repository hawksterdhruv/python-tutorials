# The easiest way to think of an assertion is to compare it to, a raise-if-not statement.
# An expression is tested, and if the result comes up false, an exception is raised.
# assert(expression), Argument

# x = -20
# assert(x > 0), "Positive Integer was expected"
# print("Condition passed")


#AssertionException can be handled

# x = False
# try :
#     assert(x)
# except AssertionError :
#     print("AssertionError has been handled")
